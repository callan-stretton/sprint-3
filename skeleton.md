What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works?

The page switches from a desktop-friendly layout to a more streamlined scrolling mobile-friendly page. All the elements have shifted to be placed on top of each other including the placeholder images that were side-by-side in the larger view and now are one on top of the other in this smaller view.

When you go to the webpage it has a set of default CSS settings. These rules are then added to or over-written by Media Queries depending on a number of things. This website's CSS by default favours small screens and starts with a simplified mobile-friendly layout. It also has two Media Queries, the first registers whether the mid-width of the browser is 400px and then alters the 'container' class's width and padding. The second Media Query checks if the min-width is 550px, and if it is it changes a whole lot more, including the column classes, to the point where you get your desktop version of the webpage. When I first opened the page I triggered the second Media Query so I got the desktop version, and when I resized to go just below 550px, I unchecked the second Media Query and fell under the first Media Query which gave me the mobile version.
