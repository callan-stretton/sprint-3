What is you site's primary purpose?
At this stage, I would like a site that showcases a few of my interests. Perhaps in the form of movies I'm looking forward to seeing this year or maybe having a few posts about things that have grabbed my attention.

Who is your target audience?
Fans of movies, TV, Marvel Studios and general things I'm also interested in.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
The first two-thirds of the page will be the main section of the site where I will have movie/tv/geeky news. On the right-hand side taking up the last third will be a side bar with all my EDA blogs. I would also like to have a banner running along the top.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
Using the grid-based design I will separate my page into classes by columns and rows. Depending on the viewer's screen size I would like to centralize everything and do away with the side-bar and integrate it into the main flow of the page for easy scrolling. I'm still undecided about what order I want the contents to go in. Whether I want the blog posts at the top and merge with the banner or have them along the bottom always accessible as you're scrolling.
